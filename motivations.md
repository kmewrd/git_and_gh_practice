## My Motivations

I was motivated to change my career because I bought a JavaScript & jQuery book years ago and committed to finally learning more about programming. In all seriousness, I did have some basic understanding of front-end languages. I am motivated by a desire to learn specialized technical skills, my love for problem solving, my propensity for planning and logical reasoning, and an appreciation of good design. (I don't just mean visual design.)
